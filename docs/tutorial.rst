chordparser's tutorial can be found at the `Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/github/titus-ong/chordparser/blob/master/notebooks/chordparser-tutorial.ipynb>`_. Simply follow along the code cells, and you'll learn how to write a script that can read a chord sheet, transpose it, convert the chords to roman numeral notation and analyse them.
