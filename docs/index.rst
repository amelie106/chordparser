Welcome to chordparser's documentation!
=======================================

chordparser is a Python 3 package that provides a musical framework for analysing chords. The :doc:`Introduction <introduction>` covers what it is and why it is.

If you are a musician, not a programmer, and you just want to see chordparser in action, the `Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T5WcH2WMHqpqbJrzxDt_Mg03lw1aXho7?usp=sharing>`_ is for you. It showcases the functions of chordparser and you can even use it for your own chord sheets without knowing any programming!

If you are a programmer however, then get started with :doc:`Installation <installation>` and jump right into using chordparser with the :doc:`hands-on Tutorial <tutorial>`. The :doc:`How-to guides <howto/main>` provide step-by-step guides on using different aspects of chordparser, while the :doc:`Reference <reference/main>` gives a full technical reference to all of chordparser's classes. Finally, the :doc:`Background <background/main>` section provides explanation and discussion of key topics.
