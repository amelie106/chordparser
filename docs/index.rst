Welcome to chordparser's documentation!
=======================================

chordparser is a Python 3 package that provides a musical framework for analysing chords. The `Introduction <introduction.html>`_ covers what it is and why it is.

Get started with `Installation <installation.html>`_ and then get an overview with the `Quickstart <quickstart.html>`_. The rest of the docs describe each musical class that chordparser provides in detail so you can use the framework effectively.
