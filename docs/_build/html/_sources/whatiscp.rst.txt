What is chordparser?
--------------------

chordparser aims to act as a framework for harmonic analysis of chords. This means that chordparser can help in understanding how each chord functions and use roman numeral chord notation to describe them.

chordparser comes with the Parser, a one-stop shop for creating, manipulating and analysing chords. The Parser can take in chord notation to create a Chord, and analyse it against other chords or keys.

To do this, chordparser has several musical classes that serve as the foundation for analysing chords. These include Notes, Keys, Scales, Chords and Romans. Chords and Romans have been built on the other classes so they can be analysed easily.
