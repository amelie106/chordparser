Why chordparser?
----------------

Current songbooks and chord sheet applications can display chord sheets beautifully and even transpose the chords (though wrongly sometimes). However, these only stop there and cannot aid in analysing chord progression despite having all the chords. chordparser seeks to take a step further by allowing musicians to analyse chords in a chord sheet while reading them and deepen their understanding of the song's chord structure.

With chordparser's musical framework, chord structures from a basic V-I cadence to more complicated secondary chords can be analysed. Here are some examples of chords that can be analysed for: diatonic chords, mode mixture/ borrowed chords, secondary dominant chords (e.g. V/V), secondary leading tone chords.

Possible applications of chordparser include incorporating it into a songbook application or reading and analysing your own chord sheets. Check out the `Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T5WcH2WMHqpqbJrzxDt_Mg03lw1aXho7?usp=sharing>`_ on how you can do that and more.
